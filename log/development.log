NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

ActionController::UnknownFormat (YazilarController#delete is missing a template for this request format and variant.

request.formats: ["text/html"]
request.variant: []

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

If the data in cache memory can be used temporarily or if the data found is not important.\r\n\r\n### 7-) Least Frequently Used (LFU):\r\nReplacement is made according to the frequency of use. It is the process of subtracting the smallest values. These transactions are carried out by keeping a counter. The frequency of use of the counters is also subtracted.\r\n\r\n### 8-) Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC):\r\nDeveloped by IBM. It is the optimized version of LRU and LFU.\r\n\r\n### 9-) Clock with adaptive replacement (CAR):\r\nClock is kept in addition to ARC. It does not depend on users' parameters. It does it using its own parameter set. It is more efficient than ARC. It uses 4 double link lists in total. Two of them determine clock data, two of them determine LRU lists. T1, innovation or short-time benefit. T2, Frequency or long-term benefit. LRU organizes its lists according to the values of these data.\r\n\r\n### 10-) Pannier: Container-based caching algorithm for compound objects:\r\nIt is used in systems where the container structure is used. It separates different, heterogeneous or separate system data in the container structure and sorts them according to their priorities. Whichever container is used more actively, this container data can use more cache. It divided the data into two as hot data and cold data. It uses multiple stages for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* cache line size: data size from 8 to 64 bytes\r\n** Direct: Direct access memory\r\n*** Set associative: Direct conversion cache memory\r\nAssociative: Associative cache memory\r\n"], ["status", 1], ["created_at", "2020-04-30 06:07:00"], ["updated_at", "2020-04-30 06:07:35.867464"]]

In addition, we can specify banned sites here. For this, we should also edit the line below.\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp_access deny forbidden\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou may want to ban multiple pages. For this, you need to define the links written to a file in the settings file. For example,\r\n\r\n```\r\nvim /etc/squid/ban_domains.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe addresses we want to ban are the following addresses.

This accessed ip address can be directly connected to squid and proxy connection can be used. If you want to revoke access. It is enough to put this line in the description line.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to grant access to a block of ip, you can specify it according to CIDR rules. By dividing it into different subnet addresses, you can ensure that certain rope ranges are used. In this way, you do not need to write different lines for each rope. For example;\r\n\r\n```\r\nacl permittedips src 77.86.72.0/8\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Connecting to the Service\r\n\r\nYou can set it in any browser (Firefox, Chrome) and settings of your computer.\r\n\r\n1. Go to Settings in Firefox.\r\n2. Click the network settings at the bottom of the page.\r\n3. You should write your port number against the IP address of your server in the manual setting section.\r\n4. \"Use this proxy presentation in all protocols.\" Check the option.\r\n5. Say ok and exit and you will see your ip address change in your browser.\r\n\r\n{{<figure src = \"squid/firefoxsquid.jpg\" title = \"Firefox\">}}\r\n\r\n\r\n[This](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-and-configure-squid-proxy-on-ubuntu-18-04/#configuring-your-browser-to-use) -proxy) you can watch the source. What I described above will be valid only in the browser.\r\n### Keeping Log and Log Limit\r\n\r\nSquid has important log files. I have listed them below.\r\n\r\n```\r\n*__/var/log/squid/access.log:__ Logs who is accessing and what they are doing.\r\n*__/var/log/squid/cache.log:__ Logs error messages generated by Squid.\r\n*__/var/log/squid/store.log:__ The log stored on the disk stores the logs of the accesses. It is a file that is against deletion of existing logs.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother important issue is that if squid wants more ram, it can allocate its own swap space. You can close it as follows;\r\n\r\n```\r\nsquid -k shutdown\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Log Cleaning\r\n\r\nIf you don't want the log file to grow too much. You can add the following rule to Crontab.\r\n\r\nYou can learn more about logging through this [address](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidLogs)."}, "commit"=>"Submit"}

It is enough to put this line in the description line.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to grant access to a block of ip, you can specify it according to CIDR rules. By dividing it into different subnet addresses, you can ensure that certain rope ranges are used. In this way, you do not need to write different lines for each rope. For example;\r\n\r\n```\r\nacl permittedips src 77.86.72.0/8\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Connecting to the Service\r\n\r\nYou can set it in any browser (Firefox, Chrome) and settings of your computer.\r\n\r\n1. Go to Settings in Firefox.\r\n2. Click the network settings at the bottom of the page.\r\n3. You should write your port number against the IP address of your server in the manual setting section.\r\n4. \"Use this proxy presentation in all protocols.\" Check the option.\r\n5. Say ok and exit and you will see your ip address change in your browser.\r\n\r\n{{<figure src = \"squid/firefoxsquid.jpg\" title = \"Firefox\">}}\r\n\r\n\r\n[This](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-and-configure-squid-proxy-on-ubuntu-18-04/#configuring-your-browser-to-use) -proxy) you can watch the source. What I described above will be valid only in the browser.\r\n### Keeping Log and Log Limit\r\n\r\nSquid has important log files. I have listed them below.\r\n\r\n```\r\n*__/var/log/squid/access.log:__ Logs who is accessing and what they are doing.\r\n*__/var/log/squid/cache.log:__ Logs error messages generated by Squid.\r\n*__/var/log/squid/store.log:__ The log stored on the disk stores the logs of the accesses. It is a file that is against deletion of existing logs.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother important issue is that if squid wants more ram, it can allocate its own swap space. You can close it as follows;\r\n\r\n```\r\nsquid -k shutdown\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Log Cleaning\r\n\r\nIf you don't want the log file to grow too much. You can add the following rule to Crontab.\r\n\r\nYou can learn more about logging through this [address](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidLogs)."], ["status", 0], ["created_at", "2020-04-30 06:08:00"], ["updated_at", "2020-04-30 06:08:42.972496"]]

It has a wide range of uses. With Squid, you can log, control, manage and route the Network. You can also check the speed of the connection in between. You can follow the link to get information about [Cache](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching). Squid can use SSL, TLS and HTTPS protocols, but unlike Privoxy, it does not support the SOCKS protocol. Squid uses port 3128 by default, you can use different port by changing it from the service setting file. # Setup We installed on Centos 7 and this should be done on the server side. ``` # yum install squid ``` The settings files of Squid are located under */etc/squid*. The purpose of the default settings files is given below. *__/etc/squid/squid.conf:__ File containing general squid settings. Usually this file will be used. This is used for operations such as adding ip addresses, adding banned websites. *__/etc/squid/mime.conf:__ Specifies the file types that can be used and viewed on the link. There are file types used in HTTP/1.1 by default. If you are banning files, you should delete it from this page. *__/etc/squid/errorpage.css:__ The file used to edit and modify the error page. *__/etc/squid/cachemgr.conf__ If the server is located in a remote location, it must be specified in this file. It is usually used for the administrator. It is used in Squid Cache Manager settings. There are error pages available under *__/usr/share/squid/errors/:__. For example ERR_ACCESS_DENIED, ERR_DNS_FAIL ... *__/etc/firewalld/services/squid.xml:__ Used to indicate the error page to be displayed when plugged into the firewall service. The application we do in the lesson is below. ```</p><!--? xml version = \"1.0\" encoding = \"utf-8\"?--><p>squid This option allows http proxying using squid. If you need to allow remote hosts to access the local squid proxy, enable this option. You need the squid package installed for this option to be useful. ``` First we need to start the firewalld service. ``` systemctl start firewalld ``` It must be allowed by the firewall to prevent it from being attached to the firewall. We have applied the following commands for these permissions. ``` firewall-cmd --zone = public --add-service squid firewall-cmd --reload ``` ### Prohibitions Some parts are shown in/etc/squid/squid.conf. The first of these; ``` acl localnet src 10.0.0.0/8 # RFC1918 possible internal network acl localnet src 172.16.0.0/12 # RFC1918 possible internal network acl localnet src 192.168.0.0/16 # RFC1918 possible internal network acl localnet src fc00 ::/7 # RFC 4193 local private network range acl localnet src fe80 ::/10 # RFC 4291 link-local (directly plugged) machines acl forbidden dstdomain www.google.com ``` With &#39;acl&#39; we specify the allowed ip addresses. In addition, we can specify banned sites here. For this, we should also edit the line below. ``` http_access deny forbidden ``` You may want to ban multiple pages. For this, you need to define the links written to a file in the settings file. For example, ``` vim /etc/squid/ban_domains.txt ``` The addresses we want to ban are the following addresses. Save and exit Vim. ``` www.youtube.com I www.facebook.co ``` You need to define from the settings file as follows. ``` acl ban_domains dstdomain &quot;/etc/squid/ban_domains.txt&quot; http_access deny ban_domains ``` After we reload the service, the list will be active. ``` systemctl reload squid ``` ### Allowing IP Ranges or IPs The use of the ACL definition is briefly as follows; acl name type definition1 definition2 If we want to allow **we need to specify allow in the http_acccess** section and write the name of the acl. http_access allow If I give an example; ``` acl permittedip src 77.86.72.49 http_access allow permittedip ``` Only one IP address is allowed here. This accessed ip address can be directly connected to squid and proxy connection can be used. If you want to revoke access. It is enough to put this line in the description line. If you want to grant access to a block of ip, you can specify it according to CIDR rules. By dividing it into different subnet addresses, you can ensure that certain rope ranges are used. In this way, you do not need to write different lines for each rope. For example; ``` acl permittedips src 77.86.72.0/8 ``` ### Connecting to the Service You can set it in any browser (Firefox, Chrome) and settings of your computer. 1. Go to Settings in Firefox. 2. Click the network settings at the bottom of the page. 3. You should write your port number against the IP address of your server in the manual setting section. 4. &quot;Use this proxy presentation in all protocols.&quot; Check the option. 5. Say ok and exit and you will see your ip address change in your browser. {{</p><p>}} [This](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-and-configure-squid-proxy-on-ubuntu-18-04/#configuring-your-browser-to-use) -proxy) you can watch the source. What I described above will be valid only in the browser. ### Keeping Log and Log Limit Squid has important log files. I have listed them below. ``` *__/var/log/squid/access.log:__ Logs who is accessing and what they are doing. *__/var/log/squid/cache.log:__ Logs error messages generated by Squid. *__/var/log/squid/store.log:__ The log stored on the disk stores the logs of the accesses. It is a file that is against deletion of existing logs. ``` Another important issue is that if squid wants more ram, it can allocate its own swap space. You can close it as follows; ``` squid -k shutdown ``` ### Log Cleaning If you don&#39;t want the log file to grow too much. You can add the following rule to Crontab. You can learn more about logging through this [address](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/SquidLogs).</p>"}, "commit"=>"Submit", "id"=>"8"}
